REFERENCE:In Cook, Illinois, the fire weather index during the summer is projected to increase from its historical value of 18.05879974 to 18.95759964 by the end of the century.


GENERATED:The classification of fire weather during the summer months in Cook, IL, is expected to experience notable changes from historical times to the end of the century, particularly under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Historically, the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for summer was classified as "High," with a 95th percentile value of 27.77916029. Although specific future projections for the FWI class under RCP scenarios are not provided, we can infer potential changes based on related climate indicators.

Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, several factors that influence fire weather conditions are projected to change significantly by the end of the century:

1. **Temperature Increases**: The maximum average temperature during summer is projected to increase by approximately 10.35°F, reaching 91.96°F. This rise in temperature can exacerbate fire weather conditions by increasing evaporation rates and drying out vegetation.

2. **Heat Index**: The daily maximum heat index during summer is expected to rise by 12.90°F, reaching 94.98°F. Additionally, the number of days with a maximum heat index over 105°F is projected to increase significantly from 0.87 days historically to 14.93 days by the end of the century.

3. **Precipitation Changes**: While summer precipitation is projected to increase slightly, the increase in temperature and heat index may offset these gains by enhancing evaporation and reducing soil moisture.

4. **Fire Weather Index (Average)**: The average FWI for summer is projected to increase by 4.98 under the RCP 8.5 scenario, indicating a potential intensification of fire weather conditions.

These changes suggest that the classification of fire weather during the summer months could shift towards more extreme conditions by the end of the century, with increased risk of fire due to higher temperatures, more frequent heatwaves, and potentially drier conditions despite increased precipitation. This highlights the importance of adaptive strategies to manage and mitigate fire risks in the future.
