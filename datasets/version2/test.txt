GENERATED:The classification of fire weather during the summer months in Cook, IL, is expected to change significantly by the end of the century. Historically, the Fire Weather Index (FWI) Class for the summer season was categorized as "High". The data provided does not include specific projections for the summer FWI class under different climate scenarios (RCP45 or RCP85) at mid-century or end-century. However, we can infer from related data trends that significant changes in temperature, precipitation, and heat index could influence fire weather conditions.

Key projections that may impact fire weather classification include:
- An increase in the daily maximum heat index, with temperatures reaching much higher extremes. For example, the number of days with a maximum heat index over 105°F is expected to increase substantially under RCP85 by the end of the century.
- Changes in precipitation patterns, with an increase in maximum daily precipitation during the summer months, which could potentially mitigate some fire risks but also lead to more intense weather events.
- Increases in average and minimum temperatures, contributing to longer periods of heat and potentially more days with conditions conducive to fire weather.

Overall, while the exact classification of fire weather in the future is not directly provided, the trends suggest a potential increase in fire weather risk due to higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. This could potentially maintain or elevate the current "High" classification of fire weather during the summer months by the end of the century.
